# Plant Moisture Control System
The system is assembled according to the schematic diagram, where the soil moisture sensor continuously measures the humidity level in the soil. A relay module—acting as an electronic switch—receives input from the sensor and controls the water pump accordingly. When the soil moisture exceeds a defined threshold, the relay turns the pump off; when the moisture drops below the threshold, the relay activates the pump.
Sensor readings are stored in a Google Firebase database, and the website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript retrieves this data in real time. The interface displays the current soil humidity level and the pump's operating status, providing users with clear and updated system information.
